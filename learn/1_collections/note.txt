#Equality and the equals methods

# Object class () has a method called equals, but can be overridden
    => obj1.equals(obj2)
    => contains method uses equals
    => default implementation checks memory address
    ## equals rules
        => reflexivity obj.equals(obj)
        => symmetry obj1.equals(obj2)
        => transitivity
        => consistency
        => non-nullity an object should never be considered as null
